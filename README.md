# Stock Market Real-Time Data Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This project demonstrates a real-time stock market data analysis system that captures live stock data, processes it using a data pipeline, and provides insights. The system utilizes **Apache Kafka** to fetch and stream real-time stock data, while **Python** is used to simulate stock market trends and analyze the data. The processed data is then stored in **AWS S3**. Using **AWS Glue Crawler** and **Glue Catalog**, the data is cataloged and prepared for querying. Finally, **AWS Athena** is used to run SQL queries on the stored data, allowing for insightful analysis and trend identification.
